# Text

Text component, used to display text information.

> Available since version 1.3.4

## Basic Usage

Set `text` to set the text content. It is recommended to use the form <code>:text='value'</code>.

```html
<ht-text
  text="Reed leaves fill the sandbar, cold sand carries shallow streams. Twenty years later, passing the south tower again. The boat tied under willows is not yet steady, how many days until mid-autumn comes again? Yellow crane at the broken cliff, has my old friend been here? The old rivers and mountains are all filled with new sorrows. Wanting to buy osmanthus flowers and bring wine, but it's never like the wanderings of youth."
></ht-text>
```

## Set Theme

Set text theme through the <code>type</code> parameter. We provide five types: <code>primary</code> <code>error</code> <code>success</code> <code>warning</code> <code>default</code>.

```html
<ht-text type="primary" text="Primary"></ht-text>
<ht-text type="error" text="Error"></ht-text>
